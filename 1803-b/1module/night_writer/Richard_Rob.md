Notes:

* Make sure you're following the interaction pattern. We want to be able to specify the file names.
* Try to keep expected and actual correct
* Good job ordering tests by complexity
* Try to do some edge case testing such as empty files
* Every method should be tested, even the helper methods. 
* Lots of Integration tests but not enough Unit Tests

## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style: 3

- [x] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
- [x] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- [x] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
- [x] Ruby methods used are logical and readable  
- [x] Developer implements appropriate enumerable methods (#each is used sparingly)
- [x] Code is indented properly
- [x] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
- [x] Each class has correctly-named files and corresponding test files in the proper directories

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components: 3

- [x] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [x] Developer writes methods less than 8 lines
- [x] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP

### 3. Test-Driven Development: 2

- [ ] Each method is tested  
- [x] Functionality is accurately covered
- [x] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   
- [ ] Balances unit and integration tests
- [ ] Evidence of edge cases testing
- [ ] Test Coverage metrics are present (SimpleCov)

### 4. Version Control: 2

- [x] Developer commits at a pace of at least 1 commit per hour
- [ ] Developer implements branching and PRs
- [x] The final submitted version is merged into master

### 5. Functionality: 3

- [x] Application meets all requirements (extension not req'd)
